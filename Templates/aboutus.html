      <p>
        ULAB Alumni Connect is built to bridge the gap between current students and alumni. 
        Our goal is simple: to build meaningful relationships, share opportunities, and create a strong support network across generations of ULABians.

      <p>
        Whether you're a student seeking guidance or an alum looking to give back — this is your space to connect, inspire, and grow together.

      <p>
        We believe that great things happen when people stay connected. 
        By encouraging open dialogue, mentorship, and collaboration, we ask <strong>'What if we stay in touch?'</strong> and answer with <strong>'Why not make it impactful?'</strong>
